        <p>I am a student in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, partaking in an intensive 6-month full-stack curriculum. While I am in the process of becoming a web developer, I also have proven experience with Adobe Creative Suite.</p>
            <p>I was born in the Dominican Republic, a small island in the Caribbean. I enjoy listening to podcasts and talking with people. My favorite book is called "The Things They Carried"; it's a fiction tale based on true stories about the soldiers in the Vietnam war. I am an avid Youtube and Netflix consumer.</p>
            <p>Finding what ticks me was never an easy task. I have a Bachelors of Arts and Sciences in Political Science. I have always had a keen interest for the social sciences. I enjoy learning about how things work and how people behave and interact. This is one of the reasons why I listen to many different podcasts. I learn many different, random but interest things by listening to podcasts.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I hope to become a skilled web developer. My hopes are that I can merge my passion for understanding how the world works and my learning in software to solve problems.
